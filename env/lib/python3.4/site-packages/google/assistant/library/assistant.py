    """Client for the Google Assistant Library.

    Provides basic control functionality and lifecycle handling for the Google
    Assistant. It is best practice to use the Assistant as a ContextManager:

        with Assistant(credentials) as assistant:

    This allows the underlying native implementation to properly handle memory
    management. Once started, the Assistant generates a stream of Events
    relaying the various states the Assistant is currently in, for example:

        ON_CONVERSATION_TURN_STARTED
        ON_END_OF_UTTERANCE
        ON_RECOGNIZING_SPEECH_FINISHED:
            {'text': 'what time is it'}
        ON_RESPONDING_STARTED:
            {'is_error_response': False}
        ON_RESPONDING_FINISHED
        ON_CONVERSATION_TURN_FINISHED:
            {'with_follow_on_turn': False}

    See google.assistant.event.EventType for details on all events and their
    arguments.

    Glossary:
        Hotword: The phrase the Assistant listens for when not muted:

            "OK Google" OR "Hey Google"

        Turn: A single user request followed by a response from the Assistant.

        Conversation: One or more turns which result in a desired final result
            from the Assistant:

            "What time is it?" -> "The time is 6:24 PM" OR
            "Set a timer" -> "Okay, for how long?" ->
            "5 minutes" -> "Sure, 5 minutes, starting now!"
